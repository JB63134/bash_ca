bash hashtable integration in trace... 

would be accurate to bash resolution
only valid for current session.

could show hash path once populated and set as resolution target if available.
would help explain why something doesnt work if it was moved since the start of the session.
but most people would start a new session if something odd happened...

something to think about.
